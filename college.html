<p>Since the mid 1980s, most computer science degrees were awarded to women, though the share of women majoring in computer 
  science has been declining. This has mostly happened because home computers were marketed and used by men and boys. In 1984-1985, about 35% of 
  computer science degrees were awarded to women (ComputerScience.Org), but in 2014 less than 20% were awarded to women.

  About half of all STEM undergraduate degrees in college are awarded to women; however, specific fields still tend to be startingly
  low in the share of women recieving degrees. Minority women tend to be hit even harder by computer science disparities. 
  In 2014, only about 5% of Computer Science degrees were awarded to women of color in the 
  United States (National Science Foundation). For women to be more interested in computer science in higher education, 
there has to be equitable classrooms, mentorship programs, and female-focused enrichment groups and programs (ComputerScience.Org).
