  <p id="h-text">The key to getting more women in computer science is to encourage more girls to nurture their interests in computer science. It is imperative that this
  happens with elementary and middle school girls when interest is still increasing. In high school and college, women must be encouraged to keep 
  with their computer science dreams. This can be done with female enrichment activities and mentors. For women to be truly encouraged to pursue
  computer science though, a cultural shift must happen in the tech field and culture-at-large.</p>
