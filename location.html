<h1 id="location">Location</h1>
<p>Talk to any realtor, and the most important thing about a house is "Location, Location, Location!" Where a girl lives dictates a lot about 
  her outcomes in life, including health, opportunity, and future income. Location often also determines education quality in the US, where property tax and education funding are directly related.
  In a segregated country, location and neighborhood are also tied to race and socioeconomic class. Internet and computer access persist as problems
  in poverty-stricken areas despite large initiatives; without access to even rudimentary technology, girls will never dream of pursuing computer sciences.
  Where a girl lives says a lot about her future chances. 
  In fact, in 3 US states in 2014, not one girl took the AP Computer Science A exam.</p>
