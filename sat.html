<h1 id="sat">The SAT and AP Courses</h1>
<p>The core SAT taken by high schoolers around the country compromises of a Math section scored out of 800. The gender gap between 
  boys and girls is 20 points with boys' average socres at 542 and girls' average score at 522 (College Board). With a redesign in 2016, gender differences in
  SAT Math scores seem to have widened. The gender gap seems to be even wider in school districts that are whiter and welathier (NY Times). On average though, 
  Black, Latinx, and Native students still have lower SAT scores overall compared to their white peers. The math SAT score disparity 
  also tends to be extrenuated at the higher percentiles of boys and girls.<br><br>
  
  AP tests are given throughout the US in May. AP test often are given to high level students and show college equivalency results in specific subjects. They are scored on a scale of 1 to 5.
  AP Calculus AB, the lower level calculus test, has roughly 50/50 participation between girls and boys, but out of all test takers for the higher level AP Calculus BC test 
only 42% are girls. The average male score AP Calculus AB was 3.03 while the female was 2.84, and in AP Calculus the average score for boys was 3.91, while for girls, it was 3.68. </p>
