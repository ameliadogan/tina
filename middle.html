<h1 id="middle">Middle School Extra-Curriculars</h1>
<p>Middle school is a key developmental period for young girls. They begin to question what is told to them, form their own perceptions of the world
  around them, and gain acute awareness of behavioral norms and expectations. Middle school age children are much more
  vulnerable to peer pressure, but they have not fully formed their own identities. This makes them far more likely to bend to society's norms (Understood.org).
  However, middle school is also a time when young girls make decisions that may seem trivial in the moment but will affect their 
  paths in high school and even college. </p>
