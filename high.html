<h1 id="high">Standardized Testing</h1>
<p>Girls do not present at the same level in science and math as boys on standardized testing. This is found across the board in the US and around the 
  world. Even in countries with more gender empowerment, women are less likely to choose STEM careers (The Atlantic). On the global, 
  OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which was administered to 15 year olds globally, boys outperform girls in math and science regularly, 
  regardless of country. The most important standardized testing in the US happens during high school before girls start to matriculate to universities. On all
  major college entrance exams, girls exhibit disparities in science and math. This can affect girls' admissions into top computer science programs.</p>
