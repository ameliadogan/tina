<h1 id="robo">Robotics Activities</h1>
<p>One of the most popular science activities in middle and elementary schools is robotics. FIRST has developed the FIRST Lego League, Jr for elementary schoolers. The robotics
  activities usually involve a challenge and a premade Lego robotics package. The FLL, Jr teams on average tend to be about 40% female, which only decreases
  to 20-30% female team members in FIRST's high school robotics programs. This is despite in elementary school that both 2/3 of girls and boys express
  interest in STEM (CodeVA). Racially, robotics also tends to get less diverse at children age. FLL, Jr coaches are majority women which provides young girls with helpful STEM
  mentors early on. Later on, though female participants in high school robotics teams tend to be more involved in fundraising and non-technical aspects 
  of the program. </p>
