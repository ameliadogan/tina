<h1 id="dance">The Arts</h1>
<p>Research shows that 74% of teen girls are interested in STEM subjects and the general field of study. However, few girls consider it their number-one career option; 
  only 13 percent say itâ€™s their first choice (Girl Scouts North Carolina Coastal Pines). Instead, girls are fast-tracked into traditionally "feminine" activities like dance, 
  theater, music, and the visual arts. The National Endowment for the Arts says that the majority of visual artists in the United States are women; however, they ultimately still 
  suffer the effects of the wage gap, earning 81 cents for every dollar made by male artists.</p>
