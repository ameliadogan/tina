<h1 id="math">Math Competitions and Activities</h1>
<p>Math competitions tend to attract the most high achieving math and science students. Math competitions can 
  help increase interest and skill in mathematics. In high achieving students though, such as in the American Math Challenge at the 99th pcercentile
  boys outnumber girls 10 to 1 (Ellison & Swanson). In middle school, children tend to be very impressionable and follow their peers and friends
  to extracirriculars. If there are few girls in a math club, even fewer girls will come with their friends. For examples, in MathCounts, one of the largest
  middle school math competitions, less than 20% of participants at the national level are girls (McGinley). The MathCounts disparity occurs despite the 
  finding that girls and boys tend to have equal amounts of anxiety around math in middle school (McGinley). This trend continues into high school
  where girls at internationa math competitions, like the IMNO, compromise on average less than 1 person per team.</p>
