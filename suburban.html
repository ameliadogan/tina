<p>Students at rural and suburban schools have consistently less access to computers and internet access than students at urban schools do. Rural 
  and suburban schools also spend between $200 and $1,700 dollars less per student than urban schools do, on average (National Center for Education
  Statistics). This disparity severely limits the opportunities afforded to students in rural and suburban areas, potentially keeping them from 
  pursuing careers in computer science.</p>
