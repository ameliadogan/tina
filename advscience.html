<h1 id="adv-sci">Advanced STEM Courses</h1>
<p>Nearly three quarters of middle school girls express interest in pursuing STEM careers in the future, but many of those girls 
  do not continue on. This growing divide starts around middle school. In middle school, students start getting funneled into different
  tracks of STEM. Young girls who know STEM mentors are also more likely to feel empowered when engaging in science; potentially,
  female teachers can help fill this role model gap. Middle school is also the peak for STEM interest, so it is important
  for girls to be tracked to achieve in STEM at this age. 
  For girls to be succesful through advanced STEM classes, girls have to be encouraged by community members, excited, and 
  given hands on experiences (Microsoft).
