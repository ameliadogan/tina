<h1 id="urban">Urban Schools</h1>
<p>Students living in urban communities have far greater resources and opportunities than students who live in rural areas. Urban schools spend
  on average between $200 and $1,700 more per student than rural and suburban schools do. This extra financing allows urban schools to provide their 
  students with more technological learning opportunities, which are often expensive (National Center for Education Statistics). Cities are also often
  centers of research and development, and their greater population densities offer more opportunities for mentors and important connections that
  will help women advance their careers.</p>
